# Employee-Content-Management-System
A command-line application that manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- Why did you build this project? I built this database for a user who needs to keep track of their employee's and their relevant criteria pertainin to their job scope
- It's a database that alloows my client to keep track of their employees in a centralized place for easy management
- I learned how to build the backend for their database and all of the compponents needed to make this database successful

 ##Problems I faced
 - I had to go back and redo the intial seeds and schema files because I did not thoroughly review the acceptance criteria
 - I ran into some issues connecting database but I was able to figure it out with help from tutor, Google, Xpert Assist, & stack overflow
 - I waas unable to figure out why my role prompt fails and does not prompt the client with the inquirer prompt for roles. I have some pseudo code for updating an employee and deleting an employee as this is something I had hoped to include in my final.
 - I learned you have to pay close attention to detail because I had 1 mispelling in my code and it took a second pair of eyes to help me locate that error 

## Installation

Run node index.js in the terminal and follow the prmpts
